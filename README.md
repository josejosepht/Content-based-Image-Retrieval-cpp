# Content-based-Image-Retrieval-cpp
The project titled "Content-Based Image Retrieval" involves developing a system that takes a target image, an image database, a method to compute image features, a distance metric for comparing features, and the desired number of output images as inputs. The system then generates an ordered list of the most similar images to the target image based on the features and distance metric. The process consists of four steps: computing features for the target image, computing features for all images in the database, calculating the distance between the target image and all database images, and finally sorting and returning the top N matches. Optionally, the features can be computed offline and stored for efficient querying. The implementation can be a command line program or a GUI application. The tasks within the project include baseline matching, histogram matching, multi-histogram matching, texture and color analysis, and custom design for specific image types.
